Background Remix AI (temporary title, product URL coming soon) is a web tool for performing AI background replacement.

Existing tools simply strip the original background and paste it on top of the foreground. Unfortunately, this usually results in a poor quality result as the lighting conditions and other scene details are not reflected in the original content.

Background Remix uses the full power of modern generative-AI to update the original foreground content to accurately reflect the change in background, while still preserving crucial details from the original image.

## Examples

<div className="gap-4">
  <figure className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Slider comparison={1} client:load />
    <figcaption>Prompt: Beach at sunset</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <Slider comparison={2} client:load />
    <figcaption>Prompt: On the surface of Mars</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
